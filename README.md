# metadata manager

Current problem with custom metadata is that Salesforce allow to export metadata using Dataloader or Workbench etc but if you already have metadata available in CSV file and want to deploy metadata records to your org than Salesforce has an issue.

This LWC component trying to solve that issue.

This Utility followes below

  1) It allow user to select the metadata
  2) Allow to select and upload the CSV file
  3) Display mapped Metadata and take confirmation
  4) Finally deploys it.
